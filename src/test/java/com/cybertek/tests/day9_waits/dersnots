Impiicitly Wait
driver.manage.timeouts.implicitlywait(29, timeunit.SECONDS)

Implicitly Wait only waits until the element located.

Implicitly Wait is set once.

As long as findElement method finds the webelement on the HTML, it does not care is it interractable, visible or not.
IT will return the element.

-------
Explicitly Wait
    Sometimes we might locate the element but no interract. Than we have to wait until it visible, clickable..
    When we have to wait, first create the object pass parameters.
    WebDriverWait wait = new WebDriverWait(driver,       10);
