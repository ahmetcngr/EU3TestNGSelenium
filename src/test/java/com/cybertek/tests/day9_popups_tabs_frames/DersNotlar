Aq burada not alabiliyormusuz lan.


Iframes :
Bu zamana kadar hep tek html li sayfalari görmüstük. Ama burda 2 tane HTML var.
Iframe let you devide your page.
A web page hase a video player. Its possible with iframes.
Selenium can see only 1 html. We have to pick a html first.
We have to switch first.
There are 3 switching ways to iframes.
frame or iframe ... same
driver.switchto.frame.

selenium can take care of only one HTML at the same time.
So if we switch to Baby HTML, then we need to switch back

In HTML we can have one html page inside to another. This is made possible by tag <iframe> or <frame>.
Using frames we can put html inside html. When we have page with frames, selenium can not control what inside the frame.
We have to switch iframe first.
When we switch to iframe it will not see the default page. Thats why we need to switch back to defaultcontent back.
