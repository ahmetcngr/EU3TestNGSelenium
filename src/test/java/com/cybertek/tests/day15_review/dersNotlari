TestBase VS BasePage

    TestBase
    we collected whatever common to all testcases here.
    Like before and after method we created all the necessary object like driver, action,wait etc. and also reporting setup.
    So we dont need to copy/paste anymore. when we create the test we extend TestBase

    BasePage
    we locate all the common elements and functionalites for all the pages/modules here related to applicaition(vytrack).
    All other pages that have those functionlites will extend the BasePage.
    it is application specific.
